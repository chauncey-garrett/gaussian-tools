# Gaussian Tools

#### Useful tools written for [Gaussian][gaussian] (an electronic structure program for computational chemistry).

These tools work for me; they may not work for you. That being said, if you find a better way to do things then by all means share!

My hope is to learn a good bit of coding as I make these scripts. I currently use them to extract data from output files and to tweak input files of larger jobs.
